To do:

Create list of therapies
Create timeline of therapies in an average CF childs day
Create log in
Create input for therapy and "done"






further app development can be found at: https://github.com/helenbobellon/Cystic_Fibrosis_App


*Sample log in*


def login():    
    user = raw_input("Username: ")
    passw = raw_input("Password: ")
    f = open("users.txt", "r")
    for line in f.readlines():
        us, pw = line.strip().split("|")
        if (user in us) and (passw in pw):
            print "Login successful!"
            return True
    print "Wrong username/password"
    return False

def menu():
    #here's a menu that the user can access if he logged in.

def main():
    log = login()
    if log == True:
         menu()



Initial code made, see initial code file;
still need to incorporate med list, and ensure log in accuracy/functioning
Still need therapies and timeline. 
Forked an app creation page to personal github account.
