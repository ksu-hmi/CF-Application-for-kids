# CF-Application-for-kids
 
An App to help monitor the daily lifestyle of Cystic Fibrosis patients

Cystic Fibrosis does not allow kids to lead normal lives due to the time sensitive and continuous medication and therapies required to control the effects of CF.
Many medication doses and therapies are missed/skipped due to the patients not wanting to stop from being normal kids and that most therpies are time consuming and 
unejoyable.  When these therapies are skipped, it increases the likelihood of these kids becoming severely ill, requiring admission to the hospital.

This application hopes to engage kids more in their treatment; to not only understand their medications and therapies but also remind and engage them in their therpaies. This application is to not only be beneficial to the kids, but also their patients, this will increase compliance on both ends. 
All patients with CF need to manage treatments, including medications, supplements, and daily airway clearance techniques as directed in their treatment plan. This application is built specifically for Cystic Fibrosis patients and helps assist in CF self-management. It offers the ability to record personal health information, monitor progress against goals and keep track of all your contacts and appointments.
